                          <h3>High fives and hellos: Local principal greets each student every morning</h3>
                          <p>SODA SPRINGS, Idaho (KIFI/KIDK) - Every morning at Thirkill Elementary School begins the same way. At 7:30 a.m., an alarm rings in principal Rod Worthington's office.</p>

                            <p>"Here we go," he says as he shuts off his phone alarm.</p>
                            
                            <p>Starting at the front door, Worthington begins to greet the students that have already made their way up to the school, most by their name.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>"If someone knows your name, that makes a difference," he said. "Especially to a kid."</p>
                            
                            <p>He tells the group good morning and to have a great day as he gives each of them a high five. Next, Worthington moves outside, where he will stand for a half-hour doing the same thing for each of his nearly 400 students.</p>
                            
                            <p>"You can tell a lot about a child when they first come into your building in the morning, what kind of day they’re going to have," Worthington said. "And our goal, my goal as a principal and our goal as a staff is to make it so every kid has a great day.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Worthington began the process as a new principal about two years ago, "and then the magic started to happen," he said. The greeting turned tradition is something that has made an impact on students.</p>
                            
                            <p>"It makes me feel good, it probably makes Mr. Worthington feel good inside too,” third-grader Drayden said.</p>
                            
                            <p>"If I had a bad morning or something like that, it would just make it better," Bodie, a fourth-grader, said."</p>
                            
                            <p>For many students, the greeting is their favorite part of the day. As a result, many run up the sidewalks.</p>
                            
                            <p>"That’s the part that I love," Worthington said. "I had a parent mention to me, they said, ‘Boy, you’ve got ‘em running down these sidewalks,’ and I said, ‘You know, I’d rather have them running to school than away from school.’”</p>
                            
                            <p>But Worthington insists that he is just the beginning. According to him, the real magic starts when the students get inside the school.</p>
                            
                            <p>Thirkill Elementary is a Leader In Me school, with a curriculum based on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.</p>
                            
                            <p>"We have that in each one of our classrooms, we have it in our daily language … it builds leaders for the future,” Worthington said.</p>
                            
                            <p>Students spend time learning everything from reading to coding.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Years ago, that was not even heard of," he said. " Education has gone into a fast forward mode ... We teach the whole child here. It's about reading, math, science, but it's a lot more than that. It's all about making sure we know where the kids are right in the beginning of the day."</p>
