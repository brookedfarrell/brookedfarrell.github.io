                      <h3 class= "target">Sally Soccermom</h3>
                      Sally is a stay at home mother. She spends quite a bit of time driving her children to and from school and sporting events. It is important for her to know how to be prepared for any weather that might happen on any given day. Especially game day. Knowing the weather might be wet allows her to prepare. She mostly uses her mobile phone, but sometimes uses a tablet to find out what the weather will be.

                    <h3 class= "target">Paul Professional</h3>
                    Paul doesn't go very far. Mostly work and home, but on occasion he likes to travel. When he does he wants to be prepared to participate in any activites that are offered. He would use the site to make sure that he isn't booking an island adventure during hurricane season, or a ski getaway during a blizzard. He uses all forms of technology as it is sometimes easier to book travel on a desktop than on a phone. But while he is away a tablet is far more convenient.
